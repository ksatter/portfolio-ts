    <h2>Hello, my name is Zeke Everest</h2>
    <p>     I am a Full stack web developer with a background in psychology using my experience and education to understand the needs presented.  Recently earned a certificate in full stack development with the University of Minnesota, where I gained proficiency in Mongo, Express, React, Node.js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  Am also confident in web responsiveness design with experience in remote development.  Able to flow around a problem to see it from multiple angles and create solutions to fit the situation.  I love to provide users with an application that fits exactly what they need and is easy to use.  With my most recent project, my team and I seamlessly collaborated to produce an application that allows users to create, view, and store a character for later use in a Dungeons and Dragons setting.  I am looking forward to applying my strengths to a team to push the team to a new level.  Located in St. Cloud, Minnesota.
</p>

<p>Additionally, I am a superior collaborator and find it easy to engage when working on a team.  I love working with others on projects and seeing the ways to best optimize each person's abilities to further improve the group.  </p>
